# Project 9 - Rest API

## Project Details
* Much like the last app (Project 8), this app also 
  showcases an intuitive way to help maintain and manage
  data within a database. A school database containing information about it's Users (or instructors) and Courses will be used to help illustrate this.
* The Users and Courses data work coherently together. A 
  Course cannot be created without having a User. Likewise, a 
  User cannot create a course unless they are first registered
  within the school's database. Also, only authorized Users
  can modify their respective courses, such as updating them or
  removing them.
* To help build this app, we used a combination of Node.js,
Express, Rest APIs, Sequelize and the SQLite Database.
